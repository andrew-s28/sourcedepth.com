## My Research

I am a PhD student in the [College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric
Sciences](https://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/) at Oregon State University. My
research focuses on <strong> coastal physical oceanography </strong> on
timescales from days to decades. Coastal regions are home to some of the most
productive ecosystems in the world and the health of these ecosystems is tightly
linked to their physical environment. I investigate how and why water properties
like temperature, salinity, and nutrients vary in space and time as a result of
oceanic and atmospheric forcing, with my questions motivated by how these
physical changes impact coastal ocean ecosystems.

To answer my research questions, I build software tools to analyze and visualize
in-situ, remote sensed, and model datasets from a variety of sources. I strongly
believe that <strong> good code makes great science </strong>, so I'm
particularly passionate about contributing to an ecosystem of open-source
software and open-source science in the oceanographic community and beyond.
